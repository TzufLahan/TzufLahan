# 👋 Hi, I'm Tzuf!

I'm a B.Sc. student in Data Engineering and an M.Sc. student and researcher working on deep learning applications for kidney cancer detection.  
My current research focuses on **combining multiple modals** to detect **kidney cancer** using **CT and MRI scans**, exploring advanced fusion techniques in real-world clinical data.  
This work leverages state-of-the-art **deep learning methods**, requiring a strong understanding of both **medical imaging** and the **theoretical foundations of machine learning**.
