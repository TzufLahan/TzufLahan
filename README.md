# 👋 Hi, I'm Tzuf <img src="https://flagcdn.com/w40/il.png" width="40"/>

I'm a B.Sc. Data Engineering graduate and an M.Sc. student and researcher in Information Systems Engineering, 
with a strong focus on applied machine learning and deep learning for real-world problems.

My current research focuses on **medical image analysis**, specifically the **detection of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)** 
using **opportunistic CT scans of the lower spine**.  
The work applies **deep learning–based methods** to non-targeted clinical imaging data, aiming to support early detection 
and real-world clinical decision making.
